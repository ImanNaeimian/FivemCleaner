FiveM Cleaner can help you delete all important traces and logs related to FiveM. It can also help spoof your PC correctly (to some extent).

🔧 How to Use:
>Run the program as Administrator.
>Select the "Useful Cleaner" option (2).
>Then use the options: 7, 8, and 10.
>If you are banned from a server, it is also recommended to use option 9.

⚠️ Note: Option 9 is not a real spoofer. It simply deletes all server-side traces. It’s best used when you’ve already been banned.

❓ When Should I Use This Tool?
1-First, uninstall your Xbox App – FiveM uses its license for tracking bans.
2-Second, run this cleaner tool.
3-Third, use your spoofer (like Eulen/RedEngin/HX/...).
4-⚠️Make sure to switch your Steam account if you banned from the server not fivem.
5-Finally, after using the spoofer, log into a new Rockstar account that is clean (not banned), launch your server, and enjoy!
