FiveM Cleaner can help you delete all important traces and logs related to FiveM. It can also help spoof your PC correctly (to some extent).

üîß How to Use:
1-Run the program as Administrator.

2-Select the "Useful Cleaner" option (2).

3-Then use the options: 7, 8, and 10.

4-If you are banned from a server, it is also recommended to use option 9.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Option 9 is not a real spoofer. It simply deletes all server-side traces. It‚Äôs best used when you‚Äôve already been banned.

‚ùì When Should I Use This Tool?
1-First, uninstall your Xbox App ‚Äì FiveM uses its license for tracking bans.
2-Second, run this cleaner tool.
3-Third, use your spoofer (like Eulen/RedEngin/HX/...).
4-‚ö†Ô∏èMake sure to switch your Steam account if you banned from the server not fivem.
5-Finally, after using the spoofer, log into a new Rockstar account that is clean (not banned), launch your server, and enjoy!
